# Project Summary

This project investigates whether session-level browsing patterns can predict a user’s intent to complete an online purchase. Specifically, we examine how engagement metrics—such as page values, bounce rates, and session timing—are associated with a higher likelihood of conversion.

Using the **Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset**, we perform exploratory data analysis and build a LASSO logistic regression model to identify the most effective approach for predicting shopping behavior.

In addition to answering this research question, this project emphasizes **reproducible data science practices**, including version control using GitHub, virtual environment set up, literate programming using Jupyter notebooks using R, and containerized computational environments using Docker.

We concluded that session-level browsing behavior provides meaningful signals for predicting purchase intent, achieving strong overall performance (AUC = 0.926, accuracy ≈ 90%), but the pronounced class imbalance limits the model’s ability to detect purchasing sessions, resulting in substantially lower sensitivity compared to specificity.

# Research Question

**Can session-level browsing patterns (e.g. Bounce Rate, Special Day) predict whether an online shopping session ends in a purchase?**

---

# Dataset

The **Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset** originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (Sakar & Kastro, 2018). 

Dataset source:

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/468/online+shoppers+purchasing+intention+dataset

The dataset contains shopper's demographic and behavior information, including variables such as:

- `Administrative`
- `Informational`
- `ProductRelated`
- `BounceRates`
- `SpecialDay`
- `Region`
- `VisitorType`
- etc.

The target variable used in this project is **Revenue**, which is a **binary** variable that indicates whether the visit has been **finalized with a transaction**.

# Methods Overview

The analysis will follow the typical stages of a data science workflow:

1. **Data Loading**  
   Import the dataset from the original source.

2. **Data Cleaning**
   Data cleaning was performed to ensure data quality, consistency, and suitability for modeling.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Summarize the dataset and create visualizations to understand relationships between shopper's behavior and intention to purchase.

4. **Modeling**  
   Build a LASSO logistic regression model to predict ending with a transaction based on behavioral and demographic features.

5. **Model Evaluation**  
   Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrices.

# How to Run the Analysis

To reproduce this analysis, follow the steps below.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UBC-DSCI-310-2025W2/dsci-310-group-04.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the project directory

```bash
cd dsci-310-group-04
```

### 3. Start the Docker Compose environment

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### 4. Wait for the analysis to complete
The analysis pipeline will run automatically inside the container.
Please allow approximately 1–2 minutes for all scripts to finish executing.

### 5. View the output
Once the analysis is complete, the rendered reports will be available in:

```bash
docs/reports
```

### 6. (Optional) Access the RStudio environment

After launching the container, open your browser and go to:
```bash
http://127.0.0.1:8787
or
http://localhost:8787
```
Log in using:
- Username: rstudio
- Password: password

### 7. Stop the container
```bash
docker compose down
```


# Running the Analysis with the Makefile (Optional)

The analysis pipeline is automatically executed when running the project using Docker or Docker Compose via the `entrypoint.sh` script.

However, if you are working inside the RStudio environment or running the project locally, you can manually execute the pipeline using the Makefile.

### Run the full analysis pipeline

```bash
make all
```
This will generate the final report at reports/predicting_online_purchasing_behavior.html

### To remove all generated files:
```bash
make clean-all
```
